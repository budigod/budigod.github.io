## Hi

I'm Vivaan Eleti, a former New Jerseyan*, a washed-up YouTuber, and a pianist**. I know almost nothing about Git, much less other coding languages, but I've been interested in technology ever since I was a little kid.
Fifth grade was when I really started doing stuff. And by "stuff", I mean making whatever the hell I want and uploading it to YouTube.
According to my "friends" during March and a little bit of April 2022, I was a stupid creep with absolutely no social life and who got rejected by his crush twice. That last part is true.
Because of my so-called friends, I sometimes thought about calling 911, or even worse--the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, because that exists in America.
Luckily, I got over it, and here I am, writing a README file for my GitHub Page. It's funny how time flies, but can't run or walk.
I do still need to consistently upload videos on my YouTube channel, however, or else I'm never looking at a screen again.
That's about it. I'm just gonna give you some links and projects. 

### Links
